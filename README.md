# kurses.py
This module uses SDL2 (or Pygame) to emulate the functions of the [conio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conio.h) and [curses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)) libraries, which are used to create text-based user interfaces. You can control the color and cursor of the text, as well as the position and size of the window, the bit depth, typography and text styles (underline, bold, italic and strikethrough).

It is designed to offer a cross-platform solution for creating text-based applications, independent of the system where they run.
